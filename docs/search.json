    "text": "Inception of one of the first artificial neural networks is credited to Dr. Kunihiko Fukushima in the 1980s. In his landmark paper, Fukushima builds on earlier work by Hubel and Wiesel who conceptualized a network of simple and complex “cells” that are capable of recognizing stimulus patterns based on geometrical similarity that simulated the way the human visual cortex processes visual information (Fukushima 1980). This network was nicknamed the “Neocognitron,” and was built off of Fukushima’s original concept of the “Cognitron’’ in 1975, which was also a self-organizing multilayered neural network model (Fukushima 1980). The main improvement introduced in the Neocognitron was the response of the network not being affected by the position of individual stimulus patterns (i.e., shifted patterns) (Fukushima 1980). Additionally, the Neocognitron introduced architecture capable of supervised learning in addition to the unsupervised methods that were present in the Cognitron (Fukushima 1980). Both the Cognitron and the Neocognitron laid the foundation for the development of more advanced convolutional neural networks (CNNs) throughout the 1990s and to modern models, as shown in Figure 1. \n\nFigure 1. Timeline of CNN development. CNN development was initiated by the work of Fukushima in the 1970s and 1980s via the introduction of the Cognitron and Neocognitron. This spurred the development of more complex CNNs during the 1990s such as LeNet-5, and modern models such as GoogLeNet and CLIP (Fukushima 1980; Krizhevsky et al. 2012; Lecun et al. 1998; Sabour et al. 2017; Simonyan and Zisserman 2014; Szegedy et al. 2015)\nIn the late 1990s, LeCun Et. Al. applied the concept of backpropagation to neural networks with the goal of recognizing digits of different handwriting styles (Lecun et al. 1998). Backpropagation is a gradient estimation algorithm used to train neural networks, including CNNs. In their paper, LeCun Et. Al. utilized the MNIST database that contained 60,000 training and 10,000 testing images of handwriting from the American Census Bureau (Lecun et al. 1998). LeCun Et. Al. directly built on the work of Fukushima, creating the LeNet CNN by giving the model an example image, asking it to predict the image (i.e., training), and then updating the model setting by comparing the ground truth to the predicted label (i.e., testing) (Lecun et al. 1998). The LeNet model (now known as LeNet-5) was a groundbreaking application of artificial neural networks from which further development in the 2000s and 2010s was built on (Lecun et al. 1998). \nOne of the primary limitations of developing models like LeCun-5 stemmed from the availability of large-scale image data. Due to this, in 2006 Fei-Fei Li began working on a database of image data that could be widely utilized by artificial intelligence researchers. This database became ImageNet, which currently houses over 14 million images that are organized according to WordNet hierarchy. ImageNet is available to researchers, but is also the focus of the annual ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC), which evaluates algorithms for object detection and image classification. The introduction of ImageNet did two things: first, a large image-based dataset became widely available for researchers, and two, an annual competition was created that encouraged innovations in CNN development. \nIn 2012, the third year of the ILSVRC, Alex Krizhevsky Et. Al. won the competition with a top-5 error of 15.3%, which was 10.8% lower than the runner-up and utilizes a CNN (Krizhevsky et al. 2012). The network, now known as AlexNet, has 8 layers (5 convolutional and 3 fully-connected) that were trained on the ImageNet dataset (which included 1.2 million high-resolution images at the time) (Krizhevsky et al. 2012). AlexNet represented a huge leap forward in the complexity of CNNs, with 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons (Krizhevsky et al. 2012). Building on this, the 2014 and 2015 ILSVRC were won by Karen Simonyan Et. Al. for their development of VGGNet and Google for their development of GoogleLeNet respectively (Simonyan and Zisserman 2014; Szegedy et al. 2015). Both of these implementations of CNN were focused at increasing the depth of the networks (Simonyan and Zisserman 2014; Szegedy et al. 2015). Microsoft introduced ResNet in 2015. \nMore recently, in 2017, Geoffrey Hinton Et. Al. introduced the idea of Capsule Networks, which are groups of neurons in a network (capsules) that can detect objects or parts of objects across different viewpoints (Sabour et al. 2017). This innovation provided several improvements on traditional CNNs, including the preservation of spatial hierarchies, generalization to new views, and reduced data requirements(Sabour et al. 2017). A few years later, in 2019, Google introduced EfficientNet, which can scale CNNs in a very structured measure and provides high accuracy with fewer parameters using the ImageNet database. Most recently in 2021, Radford Et. Al. at OpenAI introduced the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) (Radford et al. 2021). CLIP is a CNN that learns visual concepts from natural language supervision, and has been trained on a combination of images and their captions (Radford et al. 2021) CLIP bridges the gap between traditional CNN and natural language processing, providing several innovations and advancements such as generalization across tasks, increased flexibility and scalability, and having an interface to natural language (Radford et al. 2021)."

    "text": "What is the goal of the paper?\nThe paper presents the lme4 package for R, which facilitates the fitting of linear mixed-effects models. The authors aim to articulate the package’s capabilities in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion for linear mixed models and to explain the representation and optimization of such models for parameter estimation.\nWhy is it important?\nThe significance of this paper lies in its contribution to the field of computational methods for fitting mixed models—an area with many open problems. The lme4 package represents an evolution in this domain, offering more efficient computational tools and a syntax that simplifies the modeling process, especially for models with crossed random effects.\nHow is it solved? – methods\nThe package utilizes maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates for linear mixed-effects model parameters, employing numerical representation and optimization functions within R. The paper delves into the model’s structure, the evaluative steps for the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the class structure representing such models, highlighting the improvements over previous formulations.\nResults/limitations, if any.\nThe document focuses more on methodology than specific results or limitations. It details the improvement over the nlme package, addressing efficient linear algebra tools and the incorporation of profile likelihood confidence intervals on random-effects parameters. The paper emphasizes the ongoing development of the lme4 package, acknowledging the need for stability and usability for a broad range of applications.\n\n\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe goal of the paper is to provide a detailed introduction to developing and interpreting linear mixed-effects models for repeated measurements in the context of cardiothoracic surgery outcomes research. The paper uses a dataset on patients undergoing surgical pulmonary valve replacement to illustrate the steps of developing such models for clinician researchers.\nWhy is it important?\nThis work is important because the emergence of large cardio-thoracic surgery datasets, including repeated measurements over time, presents an opportunity to apply advanced modeling of outcomes. Linear mixed-effects models offer a more nuanced understanding of these outcomes compared to traditional methods, which is crucial for enhancing clinical decision-making and patient care.\nHow is it solved? – methods\nThe authors used a retrospective dataset containing serial echocardiographic measurements from patients who underwent surgical pulmonary valve replacement at Erasmus MC between 1986 and 2017. The paper discusses the construction of the model, including dealing with missing values, correlated variables, and multicollinearity. It also covers model specification, variable selection, addressing nonlinearity, and interpretation of results. An R script is provided for implementing the model.\nResults/limitations, if any.\nThe paper illustrates the construction of the model, including essential aspects such as theories of linear mixed-effects models, missing values, collinearity, interaction, nonlinearity, model specification, and results interpretation. It shows that linear mixed-effects models provide a more detailed view of repeated measurements and give more valid estimates compared to linear regression models, especially in the context of cardio-thoracic surgery outcomes research. Limitations related to model assumptions, such as linearity and normal distribution of residuals, are addressed through transformations and statistical tests.\n\n\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive guide on the use and application of Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) for ecologists and evolutionary biologists dealing with nonnormal data types, such as counts or proportions, which often do not fit well with classical statistical procedures. The paper aims to clarify the use of GLMMs, given the popularity of these models in recent years.\nWhy is it important?\nThe importance of this paper lies in its attempt to introduce GLMMs for biologists, where data often fall outside the scope of methods taught in introductory statistics classes. The paper highlights the limitations of traditional shortcuts like data transformation or ignoring random effects and advocates for GLMMs as a more appropriate statistical approach for nonnormal data with random effects.\nHow is it solved? – methods\nThe paper reviews the use and misuse of GLMMs in biology, discusses estimation and inference, and summarizes best-practice data analysis procedures. It emphasizes the need for researchers to match their statistical approaches to their data, rather than forcing data into classical statistical frameworks. The paper discusses various estimation algorithms for fitting GLMMs, including maximum likelihood (ML), pseudo- and penalized quasilikelihood (PQL), Laplace approximations, Gauss-Hermite quadrature (GHQ), and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms.\nResults/limitations, if any.\nWhile the paper provides a broad overview of GLMM procedures and best practices, it also acknowledges the challenges and controversies in statistical issues such as null hypothesis testing, stepwise regression, and the use of Bayesian statistics. It highlights that GLMMs are powerful tools but can be challenging to use, even for statisticians, due to computational difficulties in estimating parameters, especially for complex models or large numbers of random effects.\n\n\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe goal of this paper is to introduce linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) as a versatile tool for analyzing data from within-participant psychology experiments. It seeks to address the limitations of traditional analysis methods like ANOVA in handling complex data structures, such as those involving repeated measures or nested designs. The paper also introduces LMMgui, a free, graphical user interface designed to facilitate the use of LMMs for researchers using R.\nWhy is it important?\nThe importance of this work lies in its potential to enhance the analysis of experimental psychology data by providing a more flexible and robust statistical tool that can handle the complexities of within-participant designs, such as pseudoreplication and missing data. By offering a user-friendly interface for LMM analysis, the paper aims to make advanced statistical methods more accessible to researchers, thereby improving the quality and interpretability of psychological research.\nHow is it solved? – methods\nThe paper discusses the theoretical foundation of LMMs, explaining how they can accommodate various data structures and assumptions that are commonly encountered in psychology experiments. It contrasts LMMs with traditional repeated-measures ANOVA, highlighting the advantages of LMMs in terms of their flexibility and fewer stringent assumptions. The introduction of LMMgui is a significant methodological contribution, providing a step-by-step guide on how to use this tool to specify and compare different LMMs for data analysis.\nResults/limitations, if any.\nWhile the paper primarily serves as a tutorial and does not present results from a specific study, it effectively demonstrates the application of LMMs through hypothetical examples. These examples illustrate how LMMs can be used to analyze data from within-participant designs, accounting for random effects and complex variance-covariance structures. The paper acknowledges the challenges in interpreting LMM results and the potential for increased Type I error rates in certain conditions, emphasizing the need for careful model comparison and validation.\n\n\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe goal of this paper is to estimate baseline mortality (mortality under non-pandemic conditions for Belgium and the Netherlands using a linear mixed model (LMM), which can account for both fixed and random effects. If baseline mortality can be modeled, then excess mortality (the measure of the increase in mortality from all causes during a specific time period) can be used to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on mortality.\nWhy is it important?\nHistorically, 5-year weekly averages have been used to determine baseline mortality. However, this excludes year-specific trends in mortality and the effects of historical excess mortality (ex: past influenza breakouts or heat waves). Using a LMM is important because it allows for more accurate modeling that accounts for these factors in the form of random effects.\nHow is it solved? – methods\nThe paper proposes a general linear mixed model to model weekly mortality as Ytj, with t = 1,…,52 weeks and by year j = 2009…,2020.\nThe model is then adjusted to: model the cyclic pattern from year to year via random effects of Fourier terms, and reduce the influence of historical excess mortality (as mentioned above) by downweighing the residuals.\nResults/limitations, if any.\nSeveral statistics were used to evaluate the model’s forecasting accuracy, including the likelihood ratio test (LRT) and the root mean square error % (RMSE%). The models were fitted to historical mortality year from 2009- week 10 of 2020. The remaining 42 weeks of 2020 were forecasted using the LMM, along with the 5-year average model, and the ground truth data. The models all performed well, so an overall recommendation to include the down-weight procedure for past excess mortality and to include a serial correlation structure were made. The LMM did fit the mortality data better and two years were better predicted compared to the 5-year weekly average models. Many limitations exist, including differences in the reporting of COVID-19 deaths in Belgium and the Netherlands, and across the world. Additionally, it is unclear if the added complexity of LMMs provide a significant benefit over 5-year weekly average models in years besides 2014 and 2016.\n\n\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe goal of this paper is to address a potential shortcoming of LMMs, which is when data is not missing at random, but instead, data is missing that is dependent on the health-related quality-of-life of the patient (i.e., data is missing because quality-of-life – the outcome - decreased). Viewing missing data like this, a survival model may be more appropriate. Or, as this paper suggests, a joint model (JM) that includes both LMM and survival sub-models.\nWhy is it important?\nThis concept is important because clinical trials are frequently employing LMMs to evaluate longitudinal data. Clinical trials involve human subjects, which are known to be more variable compared to benchtop studies. This includes variation in the completeness of patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), especially for longitudinal studies. Many times, this variation is random, and independent of the outcome measure. However, if the outcome measure itself is having an effect on the completeness, then it could represent a major bias limitation of LMMs that should be addressed using the proposed joint models.\nHow is it solved? – methods\nThis paper first introduces the LMM that is traditional in longitudinal clinical studies like this. Then, to account for the fact that observations in quality-of-life scores ends with a dropout event, a joint model is created by linking the LMM to a survival model with shared parameters.\nThis JM was then evaluated using historical clinical trial data where a standard LMM was utilized, and in several simulation studies where extreme examples of this dependence was introduced.\nResults/limitations, if any.\nThis paper showed that poor quality-of-life scores are associated with drop out. Therefore, LMMs should be avoided when analyzing this data in clinical trials. The LMMs in both the historical studies and in the simulations were overly optimistic in estimating the quality-of-life scores. Specifically, the LMM overestimates the slope governing the prediction trajectory in both treatment and control arms. The LMM is also more optimistic for the control arm than the experimental arm, despite the protective effect of treatment on the quality-of-life score."

Then, to account for the fact that observations in quality-of-life scores ends with a dropout event, a joint model is created by linking the LMM to a survival model with shared parameters.\nThis JM was then evaluated using historical clinical trial data where a standard LMM was utilized, and in several simulation studies where extreme examples of this dependence was introduced.\nResults/limitations, if any.\nThis paper showed that poor quality-of-life scores are associated with drop out. Therefore, LMMs should be avoided when analyzing this data in clinical trials. The LMMs in both the historical studies and in the simulations were overly optimistic in estimating the quality-of-life scores. Specifically, the LMM overestimates the slope governing the prediction trajectory in both treatment and control arms. The LMM is also more optimistic for the control arm than the experimental arm, despite the protective effect of treatment on the quality-of-life score."

    "text": "INTRODUCTION TO LINEAR MIXED MODELS (oarc.ucla.edua)\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe goal of the paper is to show how linear mixed models can help analyze data sets with non independence. Non independence can happen when data is hierarchical in structure resulting in correlations within groups in the data sets resulting in the violation of the assumption of independence between observations. The example provided has a sample dataset with different patient observations belonging to multiple doctors.\nWhy is it important?\nGoing on the aforementioned example, data can be averaged on a doctor group level but his would result in less data. And you can not make inferences about an individual patient. You can also do multiple linear models for each doctor but the models themselve have less data resulting in more noise.\nHow is it solved? – methods\nLinear Mixed models find a trade off between both approaches where the random effects are still considered for each doctor but there is still an overall grand or fixed effect.\nResults/limitations, if any.\nThere was no dataset or experiment analyzed in this paper. It is just a technical overview."

Limitations related to model assumptions, such as linearity and normal distribution of residuals, are addressed through transformations and statistical tests."

    "text": "2.3 Sample Data Structure\nLMMs require a tidy data set where each variables are columns and observations are rows. Smaller datasets are usually saved as CSV files and are often loaded from a database. The dataset can contain nulls but they still need to be handled whether they are omitted or imputed and depends on the amount and which columns are affected. The lmer() function in the lme4 library will automatically drop any null values so it is important that data is inspected and visualized before contstructing any models. Below is an example of tidy data."

Categorical variables, such as Group, Subject ID, Observation_number, Hydroxyurea, Asthma, ICS, LABA, and Gender, denote different groupings, individual subjects, and attributes like medication usage and gender. Numerical variables like Age (months), Height (cm), Weight (Kg), BMI, R5Hz_PP, R20Hz_PP, X5Hz_PP, and Fres_PP provide quantitative data on subjects’ characteristics and test results. Notably, the summary also identifies missing values, such as the 14 instances in the Fres_PP variable, which warrant consideration in subsequent analysis.These columns provide measurements and estimates related to airway resistance and reactance obtained using impulse oscillometry (IOS), which is a non-invasive method for assessing respiratory function. These parameters are valuable in understanding the impact of BMI on respiratory measures in children with sickle cell disease (C-SCD) and African-American children with asthma (C-Asthma) participating in the study.\nWhy suitable for LMMs: The dataset has multiple observations, over time, for the same set of participants."

Previous efforts primarily relied on three datasets—MS-COCO, Visual Genome, and YFCC100M. MS-COCO and Visual Genome, each comprising approximately 100,000 crowd-labeled images, proved insufficient. Although YFCC100M boasted over 100 million images, the authors narrowed down the selection by filtering for quality and English-language descriptions, resulting in 15 million images comparable to those in ImageNet. The abundance of publicly available data served as a primary motivation for incorporating natural language supervision.

    "section": "2.2 Components of the CLIP Model",
    "text": "2.2 Components of the CLIP Model\nClip as a model is a combination of a variety of subcomponents that are used to achieve this association between images and text. At its core, CLIP consists of a dual encoder system, which includes separate encoders for processing text and images. The image encoder is typically based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), capable of extracting hierarchical visual features from input images. Conversely, the text encoder leverages transformer-based models to encode textual descriptions or prompts. These encoders learn to represent images and text in a shared embedding space, where semantically similar concepts are positioned closer to each other. Additionally, CLIP incorporates a contrastive learning objective, where the model is trained to maximize the similarity between matching pairs of text and images while minimizing the similarity between non-matching pairs.\n\n2.2.1 What is a Text Encoder?\n\nFigure 3. The above figure describes the role of a text encoder. (Radford et al. 2021)\nThe text encoder within CLIP is a standard transformer encoder. A transformer can be thought of as a system which takes an entire input sequence of words, then re-presents, and compares those words to create an abstract and contextualized representation of the entire input. The self-attention mechanism within a transformer is the main mechanism that creates that contextualized representation.\n\n\n2.2.2 Transformers\nTransformers are a powerful class of deep learning models that have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Unlike traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which process data sequentially or locally, transformers leverage attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies and relationships within input sequences. At the heart of a transformer architecture are self-attention mechanisms, which enable the model to weigh the importance of each token in the input sequence with respect to every other token. By attending to relevant tokens and aggregating information across the entire sequence, transformers can effectively capture global context and semantic relationships, making them highly effective for tasks such as language translation, text generation, and sentiment analysis. Additionally, transformers consist of multiple layers of self-attention and feedforward neural networks, allowing them to learn hierarchical representations of input sequences.\n\n\n2.2.3 What is an Image Encoder?\n\nFigure 4. The above figure describes the role of an image encoder. (Radford et al. 2021)\nThe image encoder converts an image into a vector (a list of numbers) that represents the image’s meaning. In the CLIP paper we employ a RESNET-50 architecture as an image encoder.\n\nFigure 5. The above figure describes a simple convolution operation where we use a horizontal line detection kernel used to detect horizontal line features in the input image.\n\n\n2.2.4 What is Convolution?\nConvolutional layers, the building blocks of CNNs, operate by applying filters (also known as kernels) to input images. These filters slide across the input image, computing a dot product between the filter weights and the pixel values within each receptive field. Figure 4 above describes a simple convolution where we use a horizontal line detecting kernel to detect horizontal line features in the input image. By stacking these convolutional kernels together, we build a CNN. The following equation (eqn 1.) defines the convolution operation.\n\n\n\n2.2.5 Convolutional Neural Network\nConvolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models specifically designed for processing structured grid-like data, such as images. CNNs are characterized by their ability to automatically learn hierarchical representations of visual features directly from raw pixel data. CNNs can effectively learn increasingly abstract and hierarchical representations of visual features, leading to robust performance in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. The whole idea behind a convolutional network is, by doing a combination of convolutions and down sampling of an image, you can extract more and more subtle feature representations which can be turned into some final output. Fig 6. describes a classic CNN architecture from a very famous object detection model YOLO (Redmon et al. 2016). In the figure each of these boxes describe an input image’s horizontal and vertical size, as well as their “depth”, in terms of number of features. The input image is an RGB image, so it has a depth of 3. By extracting more and more features, and downsampling the image via max pooling, the network distills the image into an abstract representation which is trained to hold some meaning about the image.\n\nFigure 6. A classic convolutional architecture from the YOLO paper, an landmark object detection model. (Redmon et al. 2016)\n\n\n2.2.6 Comparing the Cosine Similarity\nCosine similarity is a measure used to determine the similarity between two vectors in a high-dimensional space by computing the cosine of the angle between them. In machine learning and natural language processing, cosine similarity is valuable for comparing the similarity of documents, sentences, or words represented as vectors in a vector space model. Widely used in machine learning and natural language processing, it compares vectors’ directions rather than magnitudes, making it robust for tasks like document retrieval, text classification, and recommendation systems. The following equation 2 describes how the cosine similarity is calculated. This cosine similarity is used\n\n\nFigure 7. The figure focuses on putting the first and second part together and calculating the contrastive loss. (Radford et al. 2021)\nIn the CLIP model as seen in figure 7 cosine similarity is employed to calculate the contrastive loss by comparing the cosine similarity between text and image embeddings. This involves computing the cosine similarity between the normalized text embedding and the normalized image embedding, which helps quantify the semantic similarity between the given text and image pair. By maximizing the cosine similarity for positive pairs (matching text and image) and minimizing it for negative pairs (mismatched text and image), the model learns to effectively align semantic representations across different modalities."

By leveraging a large pre-trained language and vision model, CLIP learns to associate text prompts with corresponding images during training, allowing it to generalize to unseen classes at inference time. This capability is achieved through the model’s ability to understand natural language descriptions and relate them to visual content, enabling versatile and adaptive classification without the need for fine-tuning on specific classes."

CIFAR-10 is one of the most widely used data sets used to train computer vision tasks. We gained access to the dataset using the built-in Torchvision Dataset library.\nTo test the model out and try to train it on a broader dataset we also explored the caltech 256 dataset. The Caltech 256 dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset in computer vision, consisting of 30,607 images across 256 object categories. The dataset covers a diverse set of object classes, including animals, vehicles, household items, and natural scenes. This rich diversity makes the dataset challenging and suitable for evaluating the performance of computer vision algorithms, particularly in tasks such as object recognition, classification, and scene understanding.

By computing similarity scores between image-caption pairs, the matrix facilitates the exploration of underlying patterns and structures within multimodal data.

    "text": "4.4 Possible real world applications\n\n4.4.1 Robotics Application\nIn today’s rapidly advancing world, there is a growing demand for robots designed to perform intricate tasks aimed at enhancing our daily lives. Among the recent trends, there’s a notable surge in the development of autonomous robots. In this context, we advocate for the integration of vision and language-based models into the field of robotics. These models enable robots to leverage camera input, identify various objects within their view, and generate tailored prompts for user interaction.\nFor instance, imagine a humanoid robot equipped with vision capabilities observing objects on a table. The robot can then provide users with a range of options, such as ‘Pick up the bottle’ or ‘Dispose of the trashcan.’ This approach empowers users to receive prompts that outline the robot’s potential actions, allowing us select the most appropriate response.\n\nFigure 13. Humanoid Robotics Application. The image on the right shows the prompts that the user will see as possible actions.\n\n\n4.4.2 Healthcare Application\nThere are numerous examples throughout the healthcare field where deep learning models such as CLIP may open the door to multimodal data integration which could enhance our understanding of individual health (i.e., personalized medicine) as well as population-level epidemiology (ex: pandemic surveillance). A recent article by Acosta Et. Al. has highlighted 7 opportunities for general multimodal biomedical AI as shown in Figure 14 (Acosta et al. 2022). \n\nFigure 14. Data modalities and their applications in healthcare (Acosta et al. 2022). CLIP specifically has applications with EHR data that is uploaded as images, such as radiological scans and environmental monitoring.\nHealthcare would specifically benefit from the CLIP model where images and scans are utilized, which is common in specialities such as oncology, neurology, radiology, and orthopedics. Some CNN models are already being implemented to separate “noise’ from the true image that is produced by scans in these specialities, as shown in Figure 15 (Liu et al. 2021). As explained by Acosta Et. Al., models like CLIP could play a crucial role in not just separating noise, but also in extracting and interpreting information from scans and EHR data that are uploaded as images, which is common in Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems (Acosta et al. 2022). Taking this a step further, once analyzed by CLIP, this data could then be integrated into the existing collection of personalized omics data that is maintained in EHRs, providing a much more robust assessment of individual health. \n\nFigure 15. An example of radiological “cleaning” with CNNs (Liu et al. 2021). Low-resolution and low-count PET scans of the abdomen and brain were cleaned with a trained CNN to produce a deblurred or denoised image that resembled the full-count and high-resolution images taken on a higher quality and more expensive machine (Liu et al. 2021).\nEnvironmental monitoring is an area of medicine that is frequently overlooked but could potentially benefit from models like CLIP. Acosta Et. Al. briefly mention that these models could be used in conjunction with ambient sensors to improve remote care systems both at home and in assisted living facilities (ALFs) (Acosta et al. 2022). The CLIP model could be trained to recognize high-risk situations, such as stroke symptoms (which include physical changes) and accidents such as falls. CLIP may even be able to recognize activities of mental stimulation compared to boredom, which would benefit the goals of ALFs to provide physical as well as mental support to the aging population. \n\n\n4.4.3 Assistive Device Application\nAnother real-world application of the CLIP model is to employ the model as an assistive technology to aid people with visual impairments. Historically, the majority of blind people have had to rely on passive devices such as a walking cane to navigate their surroundings using the cane to detect objects in their path. A small number utilize guide dogs to navigate around obstacles. But these methods are not ideal. As an example, a guide dog is unable to interpret street signs. We imagine a CLIP model being combined with a large language model deployed to a device that can recognize & identify objects for the blind and for people with visual impairments. The advantage of the CLIP model is that the output object identification won’t be limited to a one-word response. Leveraging the fact that model is trained on captions and textual descriptions. The output response has the potential to be able to provide a vivid sentence describing the object as it relates to its surroundings. This would allow the visually impaired person to essentially have awareness of their environment."

    "section": "5.1 Limitations",
    "text": "5.1 Limitations\nCLIP is geared towards a contrastive objective rather than a prediction objective. While this approach requires relatively significant less computational resources it does it at a cost to accuracy. A contrastive objective tends to be better at predicting the relationship between two objects, in this case being the text and the image instead of predicting it. As such the model tends to have difficulty distinguishing between objects of a specific class.  As an example, being able to correctly label different breeds of dogs, rather having more success in just being able to classify the imagine as a dog. CLIP is a generalized model meaning that it was created to be able to recognize a wide variety of tasks by taking images and relating them to text to improve zero-shot performance. However, that generality underperforms on several specialized tasks such as medical imaging, self-driving tasks, and satellite image classification to name a few (Radford et al. 2021).\nCLIP is a new model having been introduced in 2021 and naturally the CLIP model has yet to reach the zero-shot performance accuracy of the SOTA models available today. The accuracy margin increases even more when compared to specialty models trained for a specific task as an example celebrity identification. Achieving such accuracy would require an additional 1000 times increase in the computation resources which is impossible given current hardware limitations (Radford et al. 2021). GPU, memory requirements, and energy consumption being at the forefront of those limitations given the use of today’s hardware. The hardware limitations could be one of the reasons why the researchers at OpenAI used a contrastive approach mentioned in the previous paragraph."

    "text": "5.2 Conclusion\nRegardless of these limitations the CLIP model advances image classification by combining images and text to learn. It accomplishes this by its pre-training task which harnesses image-text pairs which are jointly trained on an image encoder in addition to a text encoder. CLIP shows great promise in its efficiency in relation to its performance. By contrast the models presented in the paper were trained on a few datasets, with the largest Vision Transformer taking 12 days to train on only 592 V100 GPUs and the largest Vision Transformer taking 18 days to train on 256 V100 GPUs (Radford et al. 2021). Compare that with some of the larger image classification models taking months and some even more than a year to train. \nFurthermore, the CLIP model is scalable given the number of captions enabled images that can be found on the internet on websites such as social media sites making it ideal for self-supervised learning. Self-supervised in the sense that the training data can be scrapped directly from the internet instead of relying on people or machines to annotate and label the data. This step alone significantly reduces the pre-training time. Just as it took about a decade for the leap from LeNet to Alexnet to materialize in part due to the hardware limitations, mostly the storage capacity of computers and the advancement of the GPU.  We predict that with continuing research and the advancement of the next generation of hardware, the CLIP model will play a pivotal role in the future of classification problems."
